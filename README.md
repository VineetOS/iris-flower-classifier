# Iris Flower Classifier

This project includes a python implementation of the famous IRIS flower classifier machine learning problem.

You can download the Kaggle IRIS dataset from here: https://www.kaggle.com/arshid/iris-flower-dataset
Dataset :
1. 150 samples
2. 5 parameters (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width, class)

In this implementation, the data is trained using different machine learning algorithms using pandas
1. Logistic regression
2. Linear Discirminant Analysis
3. K Neighbors Classifier
4. Decision Tree Classifier
5. Gauissian Naive Bayes
6. Support Vector Machine

THe models are trained on the training partition of the dataset and tested on the croos validation set to get the final accuracy of every model.
THen the model with best accuracy is chosen.

# Prerequisites
1. Python3
2. Pandas package (python)
3. Sklearn package (python)
4. matplotlib package (python)

#Implementation
1. Download the python script and the csv file in the project directory.
2. Make sure both files are in the same directory.
3. Run the python script
